> **Glidearr** treats your media library like a glider riding the wind: it moves slowly forward, the world opening up ahead a little at a time, while the rearview gently lets go. As you watch, Glidearr pulls in the next thing on your horizon and releases what's already behind you — a rolling window that follows each viewer through shows, franchises, and whole universes. Reclaimed disk space isn't the goal; it's just what's left in the wake.

## What is Glidearr?

Most library tools treat your collection as a pile to *hoard* or a mess to *clean up*. Glidearr treats it as a **rolling window that moves with you**.

It watches where each viewer is in a show, a franchise, or a shared universe, and keeps the library centered on that position — bringing the **next** thing into reach and quietly letting go of what's already been seen. The result is a library that always shows the road ahead instead of the one behind, and stays lean without you ever thinking about disk space.

Where rule-based cleanup tools wait for media to go stale and then prune it, Glidearr is **forward-looking**: it's always setting up your next watch, and shedding the past is simply the trailing edge of that motion.

## How it works — the rolling window

Glidearr's window has two edges:

- **🧭 The Horizon** *(leading edge)* — acquires what's next: the next episode, the next film in the saga, the next step in a viewer's progression — at the right quality, just before it's needed, instead of grabbing everything up front.
- **🪞 The Rearview** *(trailing edge)* — releases what's behind: already-watched or no-longer-relevant titles drift out of the window, **guarded and restorable**, so nothing important is ever lost.

As you watch, the whole window glides forward. Freed space is simply the wake it leaves behind.

> **↩️ Resumption** *(planned)* — the window doesn't only move forward. When you're about to pick a series back up — or the world drops something new — Glidearr **circles back**, pulling the episodes (or the earlier film) you'll need back in and re-queueing them so you're caught up before you sit down, with priority ramping as the moment approaches:
>
> - **You come back to a show** — add a series (or just its pilot) to your watchlist, and Glidearr re-acquires the last *N* episodes you'd watched so you can pick up exactly where you left off.
> - **A new season drops** *(House of the Dragon, Silo, …)* — the previous *N* episodes are re-acquired and slotted back into your **Up Next** playlist ahead of the premiere — in order, ready to binge — with priority rising as the air date nears.
> - **A sequel from cast or crew you love** *(Spider-Man: Brand New Day, …)* — Glidearr re-acquires the previous film in the best available quality and queues it up, ramping priority toward release day.
> - **No calendar-watching required** — Glidearr compares what's coming soon against your flight-path history and lines up the catch-up automatically, so you're ready without ever tracking a release date.


## Features

- **🪟 Per-viewer rolling window** — every viewer gets their own horizon; the library follows each person's progress, not a single global state.
- **🧠 Taste-aware** — scores every title for *watchability* (your history, recency, ratings) so the window keeps what you'll actually watch next.
- **🎬 Franchise & universe aware** — follows you in order through series, franchises, and shared universes (think the MCU or Star Trek in sequence).
- **⏭️ Just-in-time acquisition** — fetches the next item as you approach it, at a sensible quality, instead of stockpiling.
- **♻️ Guarded, restorable pruning** — releases watched/low-value media only as needed, with protections so it never removes the wrong thing — and every removal can be undone.
- **💾 Space as a side-effect** — set the free-space headroom you want; Glidearr keeps you above it automatically.
- **📦 Right-sized quality** — avoids oversized files and keeps quality sane across the library.
- **🔌 Fits your stack** — works with Plex, Sonarr/Radarr (multi-instance), Tautulli, Trakt, MyAnimeList, MDBList and more; every integration is optional and degrades gracefully.
- **🛩️ Your pilot is always aboard** — pilot episodes stay in Plex at the best available quality, so you can jump back into any show at any time.
- **🗓️ Runs on your schedule** — hourly, every few hours, or whatever cadence you set, so your library stays constantly fresh.

## Safe by default

Glidearr removes media — so it's built to never surprise you:

- **Dry-run first.** Preview every decision before a single file is touched.
- **Off until you opt in.** Nothing is ever deleted unless you explicitly set a free-space target.
- **Deeply guarded.** Pilots, franchise entries, recently-watched, soon-to-air, keep-tagged, and multi-episode files are never removed.
- **Always reversible.** Every removal is ledgered and can be re-acquired if its value recovers.

## Integrations

Glidearr slots into the stack you already run. **None of these are hard requirements** — connect what you have and Glidearr uses it; leave one out and it degrades gracefully and keeps working adequately. The more you connect, the smarter the window.

- **Plex** — your media server: what's been watched, and by whom.
- **Sonarr** & **Radarr** — TV and movie library management + acquisition. **Multiple instances of each are supported** (e.g. separate Radarr instances for standard and 4K/ultra libraries).
- **Tautulli** — playback history and watch statistics.
- **Trakt**, **MyAnimeList**, and **MDBList** — taste signals, ratings, and list/availability data.
- **TheTVDB** and **Common Sense Media** — episode metadata and content/age ratings.

> Your API keys never get committed to git — see **[Security](#security)** for how Glidearr stores them.

## Getting started

> ⚠️ **Approaching first public release.** Setup instructions and published images are on the way. The snippet below is a placeholder to adapt.

**You'll need:** a running **Plex** server and **Sonarr** and/or **Radarr** — Tautulli, Trakt, MyAnimeList, and MDBList are all optional. Glidearr runs as a **Docker** container (recommended) or directly with **Python**.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml (placeholder — TODO: finalize image, env, and volumes)
services:
  glidearr:
    image: ghcr.io/youruser/glidearr:latest   # TODO
    container_name: glidearr
    environment:
      - TZ=Etc/UTC                            # TODO
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config                      # TODO
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Full installation and configuration docs: _coming soon._

## Configuration

Glidearr connects to your existing Plex + *arr services and reads your viewing activity to drive the window. Detailed configuration (service URLs/keys, headroom targets, protection rules) will be documented as the project firms up. <!-- TODO -->

## Security

**Your credentials never get committed to git.** How Glidearr stores your API keys and tokens depends on how you run it:

- **In Docker (the default):** secrets live in your **config file** on the mounted `/config` volume — git-ignored and written owner-only (`0600`). For stricter setups, inject them as `GLIDEARR_*` environment variables (Docker secrets, Kubernetes, CI) and leave the file blank — the environment value always wins.
- **On bare-metal, if you'd rather not keep keys in a file at all:** onboarding offers to store them in your **OS keystore** for whichever platform you're on — **Windows Credential Manager**, **macOS Keychain**, or the **Linux Secret Service** — encrypted at rest and never written to a readable file. Glidearr detects whether it's running inside a container and only offers this when it isn't, so the choice is yours when leakage to a file (or anywhere else) is a concern.

Either way, resolved secret values are **scrubbed from all logs**, so a debug log you share will never leak them.

## Roadmap

A snapshot after ~6 months of development. Glidearr is already a working engine — here's what's in place, what's landing next, and where it's headed.

### ✅ Available now

**The rolling window**
- **Just-in-time acquisition** — prefetches your next unwatched episodes at the right quality, budgeted by runtime, before you reach them.
- **Pilot always aboard** — every show's pilot stays in Plex at the best available quality (and is never deleted), so you can sample or resume any series anytime.
- **Per-episode quality targeting** — each episode earns its own quality tier by watch-likelihood, so the window never over-fetches.
- **Guarded, restorable reclamation** — when disk gets tight, the least-valuable *watched* media is released first (it tries quality downgrades before deleting), with deep protections (keep tags, franchises, pilots, recently-watched, soon-to-air, multi-episode files) and full restore.
- **Hard safety floor** — nothing is ever deleted unless you explicitly set a free-space target.

**Taste & curation**
- **Watchability scoring** — a 0–100 score per title from your household's habits, cast/crew/genre affinity, collection completeness, device fit, ratings, and recency — driving every keep / grab / delete / upgrade decision.
- **Recommendation acquisition** — pulls from your Trakt watchlist + recommendations and MyAnimeList plan-to-watch / seasonal charts, scores candidates, and adds them at the right library and quality (opt-in, with thresholds and per-run caps).
- **Related-title affinity** — "if you liked X, you'll like Y," via watched-neighbour graphs.

**Library & quality**
- **Automatic library routing** — classifies and sorts TV and movies into anime / kids / docs / reality / 4K / standard, for both new adds and existing libraries.
- **Kids-safe routing & age-gating** — soft certificate gating with a Common Sense Media fallback for uncertified titles.
- **English-audio prioritization** — across all quality profiles, with dedicated English-locked upgrade ladders for foreign films.
- **Quality right-sizing** — a calibrated, codec-aware size model so files are never over- or under-sized.

**Per-user & multi-instance**
- **Personalized playlists** — a deterministic, spoiler-safe "Up Next" ordering engine ranked by each viewer's taste (movies end-to-end today, with dry-run preview).
- **Multi-instance Sonarr/Radarr** — routes each title to the right instance and root folder (standard / 4K / anime).

**Integrations & automation**
- **Connected services** — Plex, Sonarr, Radarr, Tautulli, Trakt, MyAnimeList, MDBList, TheTVDB, Common Sense Media — all optional, all degrade gracefully.
- **Write-back** — keeps your Trakt collection/history and MyAnimeList progress in sync.
- **Background enrichment daemon** — continuously enriches metadata out-of-band (opt-in).
- **End-of-run report** — one consolidated grid of every decision and movement (with optional Discord notification).
- **Scheduled runs** — Task Scheduler / cron baseline, with an optional Tautulli "Watched" hook for near-instant freshness.
- **Dry-run everywhere** — preview every decision before a single write happens.

### 🚧 In progress
- [ ] **First public release** — published Docker image + setup & configuration docs.
- [ ] **Plex watchlist as a first-class next-watch signal** — multi-user watchlist union, plus a forward-validation harness that proves which signals actually predict what you watch.
- [ ] **Playlist write-back to Plex** — movies first; create/update with snapshot + restore safety.
- [ ] **Smarter decisions under pressure** — recency-aware delete ordering, likelihood-tiered deletion, and a space-aware quality ceiling.
- [ ] **Sharper acquisition tuning** — runtime-scaled episode budgets and recency-ordered prefetch.

### 🔭 Planned / exploring
- [ ] **Learned next-watch re-ranker** — a household-specific model trained on what you actually watched next, layered on top of the deterministic scorer (with a calibrated 0–1 "watch probability"); cheap wins first — diversity passes and broader candidate sourcing.
- [ ] **Cast & crew discovery** — a people co-occurrence matrix so "you love this actor/director" surfaces their other work, for both scoring and acquisition.
- [ ] **Series & saga resumption** — circle back to catch you up: re-acquire and re-queue the last *N* episodes when you add a show to your watchlist or a new season is announced, and re-grab the prior film when a favoured sequel is dated — priority ramping as the release nears. *(Detailed under **How it works** above.)*
- [ ] **Known-universe expansion** — start one corner of a shared universe (the MCU, Star Trek, the Arrowverse…) and Glidearr begins acquiring the rest of that universe in **timeline order** from where you are, weaving each connected show and film into your Up Next playlist in proper in-universe sequence.
- [ ] **Per-device codec-aware quality** — prefer the codecs each viewer's devices direct-play (no transcoding), tuned per title.
- [ ] **TV personalized playlists** — "Fresh Arrivals" and "Finish the Saga," once full episode data is in place.
- [ ] **Per-user taste throughout** — personal re-ranking that can override household defaults, plus per-profile kids-safe gating.
- [ ] **Plex, deepened** — on-deck / continue-watching, per-user ratings, an orphan/missing reconciler, and collections — all opt-in and validated before they influence any decision.
- [ ] **Performance** — vectorized batch scoring for very large libraries.
